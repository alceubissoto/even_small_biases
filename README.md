# Even Small Correlation and Diversity Shifts Pose Dataset-Bias Issues [[paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865524000333)

This code accompany our work, providing access to the datasets used and to all results reported through wandb.

## Data
All datasets used in this work, both for training and evaluation, are available in [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16GF0MyHdsi7voyTxLo69tJLvVBG5qqOy?usp=sharing) google drive.

## Results
All trainings were logged into wandb, which we share reports for [synth-synth](https://wandb.ai/alceubissoto/groupDRO_large/reports/Even-Small-Correlation-and-Diversity-Shifts-Pose-Dataset-Bias-Issues--Vmlldzo2MjczNTEz?accessToken=pq4ax23qr55jpxgvdkeaix1hfuqku9qiwv5vz15g8mr25qneyfe19qbp0gnz33ru) with access to all individual results.


## Running the code
If you want to run the code, we also provide all the scripts and code used. See the bash scripts to run all synth-synth and synth-real experiments.
